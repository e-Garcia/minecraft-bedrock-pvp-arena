# Minecraft Bedrock PvP Arena

A **Minecraft Bedrock Edition add-on** that provides a **skill-based PvP arena** with **kits on respawn**, **randomized arena spawns**, and a **teams-ready architecture**.

Designed for:
- Player-hosted Bedrock worlds (PC & mobile)
- 6–10 players (smooth PvP)
- Automatic resource pack download for joining friends

> ⚠️ **Status:** Active development — early versions focus on FFA PvP foundations.

## Planned Features

- ⚔️ Kit on every respawn (iron-tier, skill-focused)
- 🎯 Random arena spawn points
- 🏟️ Arena-friendly (Colosseum-style layouts)
- 👥 Free-for-all by default
- 🧩 Teams support scaffolded for future versions
- 📦 Auto-download resource pack on join
- 🖥️ Works on Windows host and mobile hosts (iPad/iOS/Android)

## Roadmap
- v0.1 — FFA PvP foundations (kits, spawns, arena support)
- v0.2 — Team toggles & friendly-fire rules
- v0.3 — Round system & scoreboard UI
- v0.4 — PvE "beasts" mode inside the arena

## Project Goals

- Keep PvP **skill-based**, not gear-based
- Be easy to extend (teams, rounds, PvE modes)
